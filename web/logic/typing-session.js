 * The typing session (CONTEXT.md): one opening of the phone's text editor. It mirrors a readable PC field (the mirror

 *
 * Dependencies: send(action, data) → Promise (one PC command, in order); show(view), called whenever what the phone
 * shows changes; modifiers() → the modifier keys held on the phone; notice(error) for a command that failed; now().
 *
 * The view: { open, reading, readable, blind, singleLine, kind, error, reason, field, text, selectionStart,
 * selectionEnd, keep }. kind: what the PC's field takes (email, tel, url, search, number, digits or text), for the
 * phone's keyboard. keep: the phone's field already shows this text (an echo kept while blind): leave it as it is,
 * selection included (the keyboard may be selecting in it).
 *
 * Input, from the phone's field (its text never holds anchors): edit(text, selectionStart, selectionEnd) when its text
 * or selection changed; caret(position, selected) when the keyboard moved its cursor while blind (the position counts
 * from the echo's start and can reach past it); key(name) for a key that goes to the PC as is; compositionStart()
 * and compositionEnd(text, selectionStart, selectionEnd) around an IME composition, during which the field must not be
 * written (the keyboard would commit its word again). From the app: open(), close(), poll(), connected(),
 * disconnected(), pressed(name) when a key reached the PC another way (the key rows), and clicked() after a click
 * on the PC, which may have moved its caret.
